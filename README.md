## SDSetup Complex Fetcher

Temporary script used for pulling CFW and sysmodule packages to automatically update SDSetup. Derivative of the Kosmos Builder by NicholeMattera.

This script will eventually be replaced by a more robust automatic update system that will later be integrated with SDSetup, but for now this is what will be used.

Note that release tags are used to trigger a custom firmware update on SDSetup. This is done instead of a rolling release to ensure most or all sysmodules as well as
Hekate are compatible with the latest version of Atmosphere before shipping on SDSetup.
